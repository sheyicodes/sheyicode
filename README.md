## About me
My name is Ajani Emmanuel Oluwaseyi. I am a software tester. I found out about this profession relatively recently and I liked it very much. Being a software tester has been a milestone in my professional career.Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes. I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field.
